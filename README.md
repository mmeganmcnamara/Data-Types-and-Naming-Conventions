# Learn Scala!
Hello! My name is Megan McNamara.
Together we will walk through the Scala programming langauge starting with how to download and create your first Hello World program. 

Scala can be installed on Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It can be run on VS Code (with the Metals extension), Atom, Sublime Text and more via the Langauge Server Protocol. 


## What is Scala?

Created in 2001, Scala was made to address the many criticisms of Java. It was made to show it's possible to combine functional and object-orientated programming. The name “Scala” is made from the words “scalable” and “language”, showing that it is designed to grow with the users. Scala is used for web development, data processing and distributed computing.
